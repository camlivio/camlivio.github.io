My full name is Camila Lívio Emídio, but my scholarly productions are under Camila Lívio.

### My Academic Interests
I first moved to the U.S. for a [Fulbright fellowship](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/about/flta-program) back in 2013, at the University of Pennsylvania. I've always been interested in foreign languages and linguistics, which led me to a Ph.D. in Romance Languages at the University of Georgia. During my time as a graduate student, I enjoyed learning about computational approaches for text analysis and took courses on quantitative methods, finite state machines, sociolinguistics and field methods. I have extensive teaching experience, and more recently I completed [The Carpentries Instructor Training Program](https://carpentries.org/index.html) to integrate data science into my classes, workshops and peer mentoring. 


I'm interested in:

- online communities and digital communication
- sociolinguistics
- computational approaches to text analysis 
- open access 
- open research practices
- information/misinformation
- translation and the use of corpora in translation (particularly collocation analysis and parallel text analysis)
- foreign languages in general (and the Romance languages in particular)
- the science of learning
- pragmatics
